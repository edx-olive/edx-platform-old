# So in the PonyLand as a Release Manager to perform next Release I'd like to proceed as follows:

# - tag updated service(s) repo (e.g. `edx-platform`)
# - go to group's `deployment` repo and change this single file (update version(s) of updated service(s))
# - tag this repo with `release tag` and add Release notes to it - this triggers Staging deployment.

# Production deployment is triggered manually (current state).

# If we are starting to customize another Edx tool (let's say `xqueue`) we fork/clone it into Group and add
# its configuration version into this file.
